Remove from the oven and leave to cool for a few minutes but, while still hot, twist them out of their holes and put on a wire rack to cool a bit more. Best served warm dusted with icing sugar.

        "text": "Begin by making the focaccia. Tip the flour into a large bowl along with the yeast, sugar and 2 tsp fine sea salt, then mix well. Pour in 240ml warm water plus the olive oil and mix well until a ball forms. Bring it together using your hands and tip out onto a lightly oiled work surface. Knead for 5-10 mins until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. Add the ball to a lightly oiled bowl and cover with a clean tea towel. Set aside in a warm spot for 1 hr-1 hr 30 mins or until it has doubled in size."

      {
        "text": "Once the dough has risen, lightly oil a 20cm square tin. Carefully scrape the dough into the tin and use your fingers to press it throughout the tin. Cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise for a further 30 mins. Scatter the olives over the dough and lightly oil your hands. Press down into the dough all over with your fingertips then cover again with the tea towel and leave to rise for a final 30 mins."

      {
        "text": "Meanwhile, make the pesto. Tip the pine nuts into a frying pan and set over a medium heat. Toast for 5 mins, shaking the pan regularly, until golden all over. Tip into a food processor along with the basil, parmesan, olive oil and garlic. Blitz until everything is finely chopped and emulsified. Season to taste and set aside in the fridge until needed."
      },
      {
        "text": "Heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 9. Oil your hands again and press down all over the dough for the final time. Bake for 10 mins, then reduce the temperature to 230C/210C fan/gas 8 and bake for a further 15-20 mins until the focaccia is golden and sounds hollow when tapped. Tip out onto a wire rack and leave until completely cool."

      {
        "text": "To serve, slice the focaccia in half horizontally. Spread the pesto across both halves of the bread. Top one slice with the rocket, tomatoes and prosciutto. Tear the burrata over, season, then top with the second piece of bread. To serve, drizzle over a little olive oil and cut into quarters."

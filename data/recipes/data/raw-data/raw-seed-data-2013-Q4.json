To decorate, add water to the icing sugar 1 tsp at a time and mix until you have a thick paste the consistency of toothpaste. Pipe a ring of icing on each and top with a few edible pearl balls and some sprinkles. Best served within a couple of hours of frying so that they keep their crispness."

Apart from the hundreds & thousands, beat all the cake ingredients together in a large bowl, using an electric whisk, until fully combined and smooth. Quickly but gently stir through the hundreds & thousands – don’t mix too much or the colour from them will bleed. (To get the spotty effect in the sponge, you won’t be able to use naturally dyed hundreds & thousands as the colour will bleach out during cooking. We used Wilton Rainbow Sprinkles available from Amazon.)"

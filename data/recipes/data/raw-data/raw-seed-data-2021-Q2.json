Frozen summer berries work well – just leave out the cooking time for the fruit in step 1, toss the berries with the vanilla, lemon, sugar and cordial, then follow the method from step 2. Peach melba: Slice 3 ripe peaches and toss them with 400g raspberries in step 1 for a peach melba twist. Remove the elderflower cordial if doing this twist, and top the cobbler with flaked almonds before baking. Gooseberries: Simply use the same quantity of gooseberries and cordial, but increase the amount of sugar to 80g."

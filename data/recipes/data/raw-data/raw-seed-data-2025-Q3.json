The evenings are beginning to draw in but the days can be warm and sunny and the trees are leafy, with their colours turning the same gorgeous tones of orange and pale tan as the squash themselves. This recipe is filling, yet feels light; packed full of flavour from the spices, squash and lilt of acidity from that agrodolce dressing but still satisfyingly meat-free. It has colour, texture and beauty about it with that spark of chilli heat that stops it from being too sweet. It makes a brilliant meze dish, or a starter, or even as a main course (it is wonderful tumbled through pasta, or astride a tamal). I hope you love it as much as I do.

After a few minutes of kneading, it will slowly come together in a smooth and homogeneous dough. If your dough feels too sticky, add a spoonful of flour. If too dry and not binding, add a touch of egg white or a splash of water. Wrap your dough in clingfilm and leave to rest at room temperature for 30 mins.

The crostini can be made a day ahead and stored in an airtight container. Meanwhile, heat another drizzle of oil in the pan used for the aubergine and fry the chopped celery for about 6 mins, or until it starts to soften. Scatter in the onion and cook for 8-10 mins more until soft and golden. Finely chop the garlic clove you used for the crostini, and scatter this in along with the chilli flakes, if using. Cook for another minute, then add the sugar and tomato purée. Cook for 2 mins, then add the vinegar and bubble for 10-15 mins until thickened and reduced."

Simmer for 10 mins more, stirring occasionally until thick, rich and glossy. Turn off the heat and stir through another 1 tbsp olive oil, then taste and adjust the seasoning – you want a balance of sweet and sour flavours, with a salty hit from the olives and capers. Cool to room temperature before removing and discarding the basil stalks. Stir through most of the torn basil. Will keep chilled for three days, or if serving the next day, leave in an airtight container at room temperature. (Caponata is best served at room temperature.)"

It must be a very thin layer of rice (about the thickness of a grain of rice).

Gently cut each roll into six pieces (or eight, if you would prefer very small pieces) with a sharp, wet knife. When you cut the sushi, slice it very smoothly and quickly. I recommend cleaning the knife after every cut. Repeat with the remaining nori sheet and filling ingredients. Put the cucumber rolls on a plate and sprinkle with the toasted sesame seeds."

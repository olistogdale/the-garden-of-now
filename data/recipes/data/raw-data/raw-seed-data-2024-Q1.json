Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out a portion of dough into an oval  3mm thick. Heat a large frying pan over a high heat. The higher the heat, the more bubbles you’ll get in the naan. Once heated, carefully transfer the naan to the dry frying pan using a fish slice. Leave to cook on one side for 2 mins or until nicely browned, then flip and cook for 1 min.

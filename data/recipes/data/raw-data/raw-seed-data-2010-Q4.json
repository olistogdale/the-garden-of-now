Lightly whisk the egg white with a balloon whisk until frothy and bubbly, but not too stiff. Pour the water into the flour mix, gently and briefly whisking as you go. The batter shouldn’t be completely smooth. Add the egg white, then lightly whisk in just to mix. Try and keep as many bubbles as you can so the batter stays light. Cooking two pieces of fish at a time, dip them in the batter to coat, let some of it drip off, then lower into the hot oil using a slotted spoon. Fry for 5-6 mins, making sure the oil stays at 200C and turning the fish over halfway through so it is golden all over. Lift out with a slotted spoon, drain on kitchen paper. Check the oil is back up to 200C, then repeat with remaining fish. Reheat the peas and serve with the fish, chips and lemon wedges."

Fold one-third of whites into caramel mixture in the pan, then fold that back into the whites. Divide among dishes, and use a palette knife to scrape top level. Bake until soufflés are puffed and golden – about 11 mins. The soufflés should still be a little unset in the middle, but not runny, so if you’re serving four, break into your tester to check. Return the rest to oven for 2 mins if underdone. Serve immediately with caramel sauce, warmed a little while soufflés are baking."

Bring to the boil and cook about for 5 mins until most of the liquid has boiled away and small holes appear in the rice. Turn the heat down as low as it will go. Cover the pan with a really tight-fitting lid or tin foil and leave for 10 mins. Then turn off the heat and leave for another 10 mins."

Spread the sushi rice over the bottom of the tin (the mixture will be a little sticky, so you may have to wet your hands to do this). Then cover the rice completely with smoked salmon slices. Fold the cling film over the salmon to cover pressing down well with your hands to mould everything together. You can chill the sushi in the fridge until ready to use, but try not to chill it for longer than 3 hrs or the rice will harden."

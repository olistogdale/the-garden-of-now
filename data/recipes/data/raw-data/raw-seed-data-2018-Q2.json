When the squash is all in the pan, turn the heat on again and cook until the caramel starts to bubble. Turn the heat down and cook for about 10-15 mins, making sure the caramel doesn’t burn. You want the squash to give off any water and then to start absorbing the caramel – the caramel will start to get very liquid as this happens, so turn the heat up at the end and make sure the caramel thickens up completely. Turn the heat off, drop the butter into the centre of the pan and wait for it to melt."

Allow one large handful of hulled strawberries for each cocktail. Place them in the empty shaker and give them a gentle crush with a muddler or pestle, then add the other ingredients and shake as normal and strain into your cocktail glass. Out of season, you could also make a version of this drink using Funkin strawberry purée which will be almost as good. Hemingway’s ‘Papa Doble’ daiquiri The writer Ernest Hemingway drank at El Floridita in Havana so often they ended up creating a daiquiri recipe especially for him called the Papa Doble, made with a quadruple measure of white rum, lime, grapefruit juice and maraschino liqueur. I don’t think many of us could handle a drink this size – as delicious as it is – so I’ve scaled it back a bit: 50ml white rum, 15ml pink grapefruit juice, 15ml lime juice, 15ml Luxardo maraschino liqueur, 5ml sugar syrup, shaken and strained into a cocktail glass or blended with ice, depending on what you prefer. La Terraza’s blue daiquiri Another place Hemingway liked to drink when he went fishing was a little waterside bar about 10 miles outside Havana called La Terraza. La Terraza’s signature daiquiri is made with blue curaçao, so it’s the colour of a lagoon. You can make one too, simply by substituting 15ml Bols Blue curaçao in a normal daiquiri in place of the sugar syrup. A delicious guilty pleasure on a summer’s day, especially with a cocktail umbrella."

Angostura orange bitters will give the drink more spicy, marmalade notes, while Bitter Truth orange bitters taste much more of freshly-peeled orange zest. Then make the drink as normal and garnish with a lime wedge. Minty mule Take inspiration from the mojito and mix up a dark & stormy twist with 50ml dark rum, 25ml lime juice, bitters and ginger beer served over crushed ice, garnished with a wedge of lime and a fragrant sprig of mint (for best results, give the mint a clap between your palms before tucking it into the drink as this will help to release the aromatic oils). Then add two straws and enjoy. Mexican mule Tequila really loves ginger and lime and all three come together beautifully in this Mexican twist on the mule. Just make the drink as normal but instead of rum, use a nice lightly-aged reposado tequila like Ocho or Olmeca Altos – it will give the drink a whole new layer of interest."

Add enough of the ham’s cooking liquid to thin the sauce to a double cream consistency, about 300ml. Taste and season with pepper – it should be salty enough from the ham stock, but add a little extra if it needs it. Stir in the ham, potatoes, shallots, wholegrain mustard, honey and parsley, then leave to cool."

Use this to line the base of a 23cm metal pie plate or shallow cake tin. Fill with the pie filling, then brush the edges with a little beaten egg. Roll out the remaining pastry, lay over the top, then trim the excess. Crimp the sides of the pie, if you like. Brush with more egg wash and poke 2 steam holes in the top with a sharp knife. Place the pie on the hot baking sheet and bake for 45-50 mins until crisp and golden. Serve piping hot with green veg and gravy, if you like."

Cover the chicken with foil and leave to rest for 20 mins before slicing. (If cooking in the oven, heat to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Rest a wire rack over a roasting tin and place the chicken on top.

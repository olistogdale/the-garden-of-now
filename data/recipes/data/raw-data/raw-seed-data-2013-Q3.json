Sit a cabbage parcel in the middle of each circle. Roll the pastry trimmings out again and cut out 4 more circles about 16cm in diameter. Brush the edges of the pastry on the tray with the beaten egg, then drape over the larger circles and pat them round to make a large ‘ravioli’, trying to expel any air. With a fork, push the sides together. Brush the pies generously with egg, poke a small airhole in the top of each, then sprinkle with salt flakes, if you like. Bake the pies for 20 mins until the pastry is dark golden. Remove and leave to rest for 10 mins."

To serve, carefully carve each pie in half so you see the cross section of breast, and serve with a little of the sauce poured around."

Sit the second sponge about an inch down from one of the ends of the bottom sponge (it doesn’t matter which is chocolate and which is orange).

Where each strip ends, you’ll stick on a matching sponge – so a chocolate strip always continues with another chocolate, and the same with orange (see steps C & D in the Guide). This is the fiddly bit, as you’ll find you’ll need to partly stick on 1 coloured strip, then snuggle in the other coloured strip partway through. (This sounds more complicated than it is.

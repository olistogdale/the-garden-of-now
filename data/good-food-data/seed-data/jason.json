You can also add the trimmed ends of the onions, carrots, parsnip and celery. Season with a pinch of salt and pour over enough cold water to cover the chicken carcass, around 1.5 litres. Bring to a simmer on a medium heat, then gently simmer for 45 mins-1 hr, skimming away any scum that rises to the surface. Using a potato masher, break up the chicken carcass to extract more flavour. Pour the stock through a fine sieve into a large bowl, pressing down on the bones again. Discard the contents of the sieve and set the stock aside. You should have around 1 litre.'

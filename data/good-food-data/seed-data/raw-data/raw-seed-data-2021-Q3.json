If you don’t have a thermometer, spoon a little of the jam onto the chilled saucer, leave it for 30 seconds, then draw a line through it with your finger – if it wrinkles and doesn’t flood the gap, it’s ready. If not, boil for 2 mins more, then check again."

Unopened jars will keep for up to a year. Once opened, keep the jam in the fridge and eat within a month."

Pile the apple slices into the centre of the pastry circle using your hands, letting any excess syrup drip back into the bowl as you do (save the syrup for later).

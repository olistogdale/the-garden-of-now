Using a serrated knife to cut down the middle of the buns, from the top and stopping around 2cm from the base. Spoon the cream into a piping bag, if you have one, and fill the buns with it, or use the spoon. (If using a piping bag, snip a hole in the end that’s large enough for the raspberries to come through.) While doing this, open the buns slightly, being careful not to break the base. Use the flat side of a cutlery knife or an offset spatula to scrape away any excess cream and achieve a smooth finish. Dip the maritozzi in the chopped hazelnuts and tear over the remaining raspberries. Dust with icing sugar to serve, if you like. Best served on the day of making but will keep in the fridge for to to two days."

Add a pinch of salt and whisk with an electric whisk or in a stand mixer for 3-5 mins until fluffy and doubled in volume. Add the caster sugar, a spoonful at a time, whisking continuously until all the sugar has been incorporated and the meringue is glossy and stiff. Scatter the ground nut mixture over the surface, then use a large metal spoon to gently fold this into the meringue. Transfer the meringue to a piping bag fitted with a large round nozzle."

Bake the meringues for 1 hr, swapping the trays around after 30 mins so they cook evenly. After 1 hr, leave to cool in the oven with the door closed for at least 2 hrs, or overnight."

Meanwhile, briefly whisk the vanilla, cornflour, caster sugar and egg yolks together in a large bowl until just combined. Slowly pour the hot milk mixture over the egg yolk mixture, whisking continuously. Strain the mixture through a sieve back into the saucepan, then set over a low-medium heat and cook, stirring continuously with a rubber spatula to prevent the mixture from burning, for 4-5 mins. Don’t rush this as the eggs can easily scramble. After this time, the custard should be thick and smooth. Remove the pan from the heat, scrape the custard into a clean bowl, cover the surface and chill for 1-2 hrs until completely cold."

Cook, without stirring, until the sugar has dissolved and turned from amber to deep caramel – you can swirl the pan occasionally, but don't stir. Tip in the toasted hazelnuts and swirl to coat in caramel, then tip onto the oiled baking tray. Sprinkle over a pinch of salt and leave to set until hard, about 20 mins. Once set, break the praline into shards and blitz in a food processor to a coarse rubble."

Best eaten straightaway, but will keep chilled for up to three days."

Squeeze the juice from both limes into a measuring jug – stop when you get to about 60ml, then top it up with water so you have 100ml of liquid in total. Pour this into your pan with the caster sugar. Heat very gently, stirring occasionally just until the sugar has dissolved, but don’t let it boil. Strain the mixture into a heatproof jug and leave to cool. Makes 280-300ml. Lasts up to two weeks."

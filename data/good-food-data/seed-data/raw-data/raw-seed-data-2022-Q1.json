Be careful not to overbeat the eggs, as this will make the batter stiff. Stir in the cooled herb mixture until the egg mixture turns completely green. Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and smooth the surface using a fork. Bake for 35-40 mins, or until a cutlery knife inserted into the middle comes out clean – there should be no remaining raw egg mixture. Serve warm or at room temperature, cut into small squares or triangles."

Roll the pastry out on a lightly floured surface to the thickness of a pound coin and cut out four circles about 12cm wide, arranging them on a baking tray lined with baking parchment. Put a quarter of the potato mixture into the middle of each pastry circle, leaving a border. Re-roll the pastry offcuts, then cut out four more circles, about 8cm wide. Brush the borders of the larger pastry circles with the spiced egg, then drape the smaller circles over the potato filling. Pinch the borders to seal. Brush the pies with more of the spiced egg and scatter over a pinch of cumin seeds. Will keep frozen for up to two months. Defrost fully before baking."

The mixture will seem quite watery at first, but the trick is to finish cooking the bucatini by simmering it in the broth – it will soak it all up and take on the earthy flavour. Keep moving the pasta in the broth using the tongs for 3 mins, or until most of the water has been absorbed. Stir in the cream, a grating of nutmeg and the parsley. Stir well, taste for seasoning and serve topped with lots of parmesan."

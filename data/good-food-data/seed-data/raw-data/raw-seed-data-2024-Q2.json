Turn the naan over carefully, wet the back of it with plain water, then carefully place on the heated tawa/frying pan. Place the pan on the hob, cook for about 1 min or until small bubbles appear on the surface of the naan, then brush the warm rosewater-milk on top. Lift the pan and flip it (with the bread stuck to the pan), holding it directly over the flame – it won't fall off because the water ensures it sticks on (this is what happens in a tandoor). Cook over the open flame evenly until it starts to go dark and charred in places. Gently remove the naan with a metal spatula, then brush with melted ghee and sprinkle over the remaining pistachios, flaked almonds and crystallised rose petals now, if using.

If you've got time, leave to marinate in the fridge for at least 8 hrs, or up to 24 hrs. This is optional, but results in better flavour and makes the pork more tender. (If you don't have time to marinate, continue to step two.)"

Remove from the oven and leave to cool, then slice thinly. If you don't have time to leave it to cool, shred it using two forks (you won't be able to slice it neatly while still warm).

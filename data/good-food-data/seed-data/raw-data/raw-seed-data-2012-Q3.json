Whichever choice is made, it is important to leave ample space between the meringues to allow them to swell and rise. These can now be baked for 45-50 minutes, about 1 hour maximum. During this time they will take on a light colour, forming a crisp shell that coats the marshmallow centre. The meringues can be cooked at a higher temperature - 150C/Gas 2/fan oven 130C - to give slightly more colour. If so, cooking time will be slightly less, around 40-45 minutes."

The ice cream can now be scooped or scrolled using a warm tablespoon, before sitting on top of the meringue. The syrup with candied fruit can now be drizzled over to finish. The alternative is to simply sit the ice cream and meringue side by side, decorating with segments, if using, and drizzling over the syrup. Whichever you choose, either can be finished with a light dusting of icing sugar, if desired, and perhaps a leaf or sprig of holly."

As you’re rolling the pastry thinner than usual, handle it carefully to prevent it breaking, and keep the work surface and rolling pin lightly dusted with flour to prevent the pastry sticking. Use the base of a 20cm loose-bottomed cake tin (or similar) as a guide to cut around to neaten the pastry edges (step 1). Spoon a sixth of the filling down the centre of the pastry circle and lightly press down with your hand to contain and flatten it slightly. Dampen the pastry edges with water (step 2) and carefully bring one side of the pastry over to join the other side (step 3), tucking in the filling to keep it inside as you do so. Press the joins together to seal, then make a thin decorative edge by rolling or curling the pastry edge over all the way around. Press down to seal. Repeat with the remaining pastry and filling. Sit each pasty on the baking sheet or tray, then pierce a small hole in the top of each one for the steam to escape.

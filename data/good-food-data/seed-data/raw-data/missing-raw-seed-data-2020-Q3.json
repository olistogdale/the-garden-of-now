Poke the rosemary sprigs in and around the holly branches, and arrange the whole walnuts, bay leaves, cinnamon sticks, and clove-studded clementines around the wreath. Will stay fresh for up to four days. To prevent a fire hazard, swap the candle for a new one as it burns down so it does not come into contact with the holly wreath."

Beat the egg yolks with 2 tbsp cold water, then drizzle this into the food processor and blend again until the dough starts to clump together. Tip onto a work surface and knead briefly to bring everything together into a smooth dough. Divide into two pieces and shape each piece into a puck shape. Wrap and refrigerate for 30 mins. Will keep, wrapped in the fridge, for up to two days."

Dust a work surface with a little flour, then unwrap one piece of the pie dough. Carefully roll it out until it’s large enough to line the base and sides of a 9-10in pie dish or ovenproof skillet pan. The dough will be very delicate – if any cracks appear when rolling, squash them back together. Lift the dough over the rolling pin and into the dish – don’t worry if it breaks, just patch it up by pushing it into the edge and up the side, closing any holes. There should be a little overhang around the edge. Sprinkle the reserved 2 tbsp ground almonds over the base, then spoon in the cherry filling so it's in an even layer."

Top the pie with the dough lid (poke a hole in the center for steam to escape), or make a lattice topping. To do this, cut the rolled-out dough into strips, however wide you like. Arrange half the strips in one direction over the pie, leaving a 1in gap between each. Weave the remaining strips under and over these in the opposite direction, creating a lattice pattern. Press the dough together around the edge, then trim the excess using a sharp knife."

Stick them on with a little more egg wash, then brush the whole pie with a thin layer of egg wash. Sprinkle over a little sugar. Bake for 55 mins-1 hr, checking the pie after 40 mins. The edge may brown more quickly than the center – if this happens, wrap some foil around the edge to protect it."

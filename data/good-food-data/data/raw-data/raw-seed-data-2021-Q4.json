Hold the ruler over the pastry circle and, starting from the left or right side, cut 1cm vertical lines in the pastry going from top to bottom, leaving 1cm gaps between the incisions. After completing one line of cuts, move the ruler ½cm to the side and make another line of cuts. Continue all the way along the pastry. Gently tease the holes open with your fingers to create a webbed lattice effect, then use the same 20cm template to retrim the lid. Carefully lift it over the pie, folding over the excess pastry and crimping all the way around the edge to seal. Brush the pastry with some of the beaten egg. Re-roll any offcuts and use to decorate the pie, if you like (we cut out star shapes). Stick these on and brush with more beaten egg. Will keep covered, uncooked, in the fridge for up to 24 hrs."

Pour the liquid into a large bowl or stand mixer. Add the cream of tartar, then beat with the whisk attachment or an electric whisk for 15-18 mins until the mixture has tripled in size and is holding stiff peaks (it will take a while for it to thicken initially, so just keep beating until this happens).

The speed at which it ferments will also depend on the season. If it’s warm, the process will be quicker; if it’s cold, slower. I like to check my ferment every day to see how it’s coming on, and also to lift off the muslin and parchment to release those fermentation gases before resealing (known as burping), so that the jar doesn’t explode. When you’re happy with the taste, remove the parchment and muslin, seal with the lid and store in the fridge to stop it fermenting any further. Will keep for months."

Take the lower left edge of the circle (if it was a clock face, it would be from 5 to 8 o'clock) and fold it at an angle towards the centre to make a flap that covers the left third of the circle. Next, take the opposite side of the circle (7 to 3 o’clock) and fold it up towards the centre, slightly overlapping the left side flap to create a triangular tip at the bottom of the circle. You should be able to see the filling in the middle. Finally, fold the top part of the circle downwards to create a third flap and complete the triangle — a small triangle of filling should be visible in the centre. Gently press the points of the triangle together to make them really stick. Ideally, you want the edges to be over the next one on one side and under on the other to create a pinwheel effect. Place the hamantaschen on a baking tray lined with baking parchment and chill for 20-30 mins to firm up. Repeat with the remaining circles, then with the second disc of dough and the remaining filling."

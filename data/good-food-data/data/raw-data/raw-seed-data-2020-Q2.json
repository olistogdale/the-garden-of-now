Use the pastry to line a 23cm tart tin (use the rolling pin to help you do this). Trim the edges so they’re just overhanging the sides. Patch the pastry with the offcuts, if needed. Scrunch up a sheet of baking parchment, then open it out again to line the pastry, and fill with baking beans. Bake for 15 mins, remove the parchment and beans, then bake for a further 5-8 mins, or until the pastry looks dry, without any raw spots."

Bring to a gentle simmer, then add the gooseberries and cook for 8 mins, or until tender. Drain, reserving the poaching liquid. Lightly mash the gooseberries to break them up a little, then leave to cool. Taste to check for sweetness, and add a little more sugar if you like (remember that the cream and sponge are both sweet, though). Boil the reserved poaching liquid for 8-10 mins until syrupy, then add the cordial. Leave to cool completely."

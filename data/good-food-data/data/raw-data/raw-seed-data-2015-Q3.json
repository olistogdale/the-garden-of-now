Once covered, chill for at least 30 mins to firm up the icing. Chill the remaining icing too, but bring it out of the fridge 10-15 mins before the cake so it is ready for spreading."

Roughly chop the remaining toasted nuts and scatter over the top. Serve in slices with extra figs on the side, if you like.

Place over a low-medium heat until the sugar has melted, then increase the heat and boil with a sugar thermometer in the pan. When the thermometer reaches 100C, beat the whites with an electric whisk until stiff peaks form. Keep boiling the sugar syrup until it reaches soft-ball stage – 113C on the thermometer. Remove from the heat and, while beating the whites, pour in the syrup in a slow, steady stream – avoid hitting the whisk blades. Keep beating until the meringue is stiff. Use a large spoon to pile on top of the cheesecake, then use a blowtorch to caramelise the meringue, or bake at 200C/180C fan/gas 6 for 5 mins or so. Chill until ready to serve."

      "400g Lebanese or Kirby cucumber (about 6-7 small ones), cut into 1cm thick slices (available at Whole Foods or from a greengrocer)",
      "1 medium onion cut into thick slices",
      "2 tbsp rock or flaked sea salt",
      "300ml apple cider vinegar",
      "140g golden caster sugar",
      "¼ tsp ground turmeric",

        "text": "Meanwhile, put the vinegar, 200ml water, the sugar, turmeric, celery seeds, chilli flakes and mustard seeds in a small saucepan over a medium heat. Bring to the boil and simmer for 5 mins. Remove from the heat and leave to cool to room temperature. Put the cucumber and onion mixture in a 500ml- capacity jar or sealable plastic container, pour over the brining liquid, cover and seal. Chill for at least 3 hrs. Will keep in the fridge for 2 weeks."

Dredge the hazelnut through the thickened caramel, coating it very generously indeed. Secure the cocktail stick to the work surface with some sticky tape or wedge under a heavy pan, so that the caramel covered hazelnut hangs over the edge. Allow the caramel to drip, like a stalactite, towards the floor and set hard. Repeat with all the hazelnuts and allow the caramel to set. When hardened, use scissors to gently trim the fine threads of caramel off the more robust, decorative spikes. Arrange the hazelnuts, spikes pointing up, in the centre of the cake."

Meanwhile, add the cream to the pan, increase the heat and bubble for 10-15 mins until the liquid has reduced to a white sauce consistency. Add seasoning (remembering that the chorizo can be quite salty) and return the chicken to the pan along with the parsley. Transfer to a pie dish (ours was 20cm x 25cm) and place a pie funnel or piping nozzle in the centre. Set aside to cool a little while you prepare the pastry."

Roll into thin, wide strips (it’s preferable to end up with a mixture of lengths), then use a sharp knife to cut them lengthways to create two pieces. ❤ Make a thin paste using icing sugar and water, then spread a little along the flat edges of the strips. ❤ Stick them to the sides of the cake, starting at the bottom and working up. Bend the fondant to create pleats and waves. Overlap from the bottom up until all the sides are covered. ❤ Decorate with a cake topper if you like. Design 3: Polka dot (keeps for 3-4 days) ❤ Roll 700g pink sugar paste out on a surface dusted with icing sugar. Drape over the largest cake after the buttercream has chilled, but before stacking. Smooth it over, then trim off the excess. ❤ Do the same with 450g of white fondant icing for the top layer. ❤ Make a thick paste using icing sugar and water, and use it to stick on white chocolate buttons and white chocolate jazzies onto the larger cake to create a polka dot effect. ❤ Push 2-3 tbsp edible silver balls into the smaller layer’s icing, then stack the cakes. ❤ Add a cake topper and a ribbon, if you like."

If cooking outside, lay the crackling on the grates and cook, turning occasionally, until it is puffed up and golden, while the pork is on the other side of the barbecue, heating through and nicely browning. Leave to rest for 10 mins before bringing to the table and carving. If cooking in the oven, lay the crackling on a wire rack over a baking tray on the top shelf and cook until crisp, while the pork reheats and browns underneath. If necessary, turn on the grill while the pork rests to really crisp up the crackling."

When the stock has been absorbed, it’s time to add the next ladleful and so on. It will take about 15 mins to reach the final ladle of stock.

Garnish with an orange slice. Brandy Collins This is a really refreshing way to enjoy cognac. For best results, use a young-ish VS or VSOP cognac that’s nice and fruity. Just make the drink as normal, substituting cognac for gin, then garnish with a slice of ginger or a ribbon of lemon peel. Elderflower Collins Elderflower and lemon is a winning combination. You can make it with elderflower cordial or liqueur for something a touch more boozy. Mix the drink as normal, but use the liqueur or cordial in place of the sugar syrup. Garnish with a lemon slice."

Start by muddling 6 blackberries in a rocks glass. Add 50ml gin, 25ml lemon juice, 25ml sugar syrup and fill the glass two thirds full with crushed ice. Mix with a long-handled spoon. Top with more crushed ice, a garnish and paper straws. Bramble royale Go glam with your bramble by adding a splash of champagne to the mix. Just make the drink as normal but reduce the amount of crushed ice by about a third to leave room for the fizz. Then top with 25-50ml of champagne, mix gently, add a bit more crushed ice, garnish and serve. Peach sour The classic ‘sour’ formula that the bramble sticks to is easy to adapt by switching out the liqueur. Try 12.5ml of crème de peche instead of crème de mure – it might not look quite as eye-catching as the bloodshot bramble but it will taste just as delicious."

        "text": "First, make the pie crust. Tip the flour, ⅓ cup ground almonds, the butter, sugar, and ¼ tsp salt into a food processor. Blend until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Beat the egg yolks with 2 tbsp cold water, then drizzle this into the food processor and blend again until the dough starts to clump together. Tip onto a work surface and knead briefly to bring everything together into a smooth dough. Divide into two pieces and shape each piece into a puck shape. Wrap and refrigerate for 30 mins. Will keep, wrapped in the fridge, for up to two days."

        "text": "If the pastry has been chilled for longer than 30 mins, bring it out of the fridge 20 mins before rolling, or it will be too firm. Heat the oven to 400F/gas 6. Dust a work surface with a little flour, then unwrap one piece of the pie dough. Carefully roll it out until it’s large enough to line the base and sides of a 9-10in pie dish or ovenproof skillet pan. The dough will be very delicate – if any cracks appear when rolling, squash them back together. Lift the dough over the rolling pin and into the dish – don’t worry if it breaks, just patch it up by pushing it into the edge and up the side, closing any holes. There should be a little overhang around the edge. Sprinkle the reserved 2 tbsp ground almonds over the base, then spoon in the cherry filling so it's in an even layer."

      {
        "text": "Roll out the remaining dough so it’s large enough to cover the pie. Brush a little of the beaten egg white around the edge. Top the pie with the dough lid (poke a hole in the center for steam to escape), or make a lattice topping. To do this, cut the rolled-out dough into strips, however wide you like. Arrange half the strips in one direction over the pie, leaving a 1in gap between each. Weave the remaining strips under and over these in the opposite direction, creating a lattice pattern. Press the dough together around the edge, then trim the excess using a sharp knife."

      {
        "text": "Crimp the edge for a neat finish or use any dough scraps to make shapes and place them around edge – we used a piping nozzle to cut out small circles. Stick them on with a little more egg wash, then brush the whole pie with a thin layer of egg wash. Sprinkle over a little sugar. Bake for 55 mins-1 hr, checking the pie after 40 mins. The edge may brown more quickly than the center – if this happens, wrap some foil around the edge to protect it."

        "text": "Remove from the oven and leave to cool for 1 hr. If you cut it too soon, the filling will be very runny. Best served just warm with ice cream."

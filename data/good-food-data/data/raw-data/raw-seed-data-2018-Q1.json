Instead of Angostura bitters, try using orange bitters, and garnish with an orange twist. Tequila old fashioned Anejo tequila has lots of vanilla and caramel notes that work very nicely in an old fashioned. For the sweetener, use agave syrup instead of sugar syrup, although agave syrup tends to be sweeter, so you may need slightly less. Garnish with a lemon twist. Smoky old fashioned To add a hint of smoke, infuse your sugar syrup. Simply make a 2:1 sugar syrup and while it’s still warm, put a Lapsang Souchong teabag in the syrup and leave to infuse for half-an-hour. Then make your old fashioned as normal."

Sprinkle your choice of crumble mixture loosely and roughly over the top, then bake for 30-40 mins until the crumble has browned and the filling is bubbling at the sides (30 mins if you part-baked the crumble, but keep an eye on it). Leave to rest for 10 mins before serving. While the crumble is baking, make the optional sugar and spice blend by mixing all the ingredients with a small pinch of salt. Serve on the side to sprinkle over."

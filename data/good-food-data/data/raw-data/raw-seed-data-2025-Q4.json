There will be a gap running along the top of the roof, as the sponge fingers won’t be long enough to completely cover the slope, so you can use a few more to fill this, cutting as needed to fit.

Decorate the house with the cookie windows, door, star and wreath (using the vanilla spiced cookies recipe), pushing them into the buttercream or icing. If you find the windows are sliding, secure with a couple of cocktail sticks to hold them in place while setting. Leave the whole cake to set for a couple of hours at room temperature, then remove any cocktail sticks you’ve used to secure the roof or decorations before serving.

Roll the rest of the marzipan out on a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar until it’s large enough to cover the top and side of the cake – use a piece of string to help you measure, if needed. Carefully lift the marzipan over the cake using a rolling pin, then smooth it over the top and down the side using your palms. Trim any excess using a knife, then keep the offcuts covered with a tea towel so they don’t dry out."

You can also arrange them in a scattered pattern across just the top if you’d like to tie a decorative ribbon around the base of the cake. Once decorated, will keep in an airtight container for up to two months, or up to a few weeks once it has been sliced."

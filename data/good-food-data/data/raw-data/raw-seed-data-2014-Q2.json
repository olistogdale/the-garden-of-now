Season, then roll up tightly from the opposite side and pinch to seal. Use a sharp, floured knife to cut roll into 8 slices. Dust a baking sheet with more flour and place slices, cut-side up, with gaps in between. Brush tops with more egg and bake for 15-20 mins until golden and risen. Best eaten warm with cornichons."

Heat a medium non-stick pan over a low-medium heat and add the oil, spreading it over the surface with a spatula. Pour in a quarter of the egg mixture and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan, forming a very thin omelette. Cook for about 4-5 mins until the top is dry and the bottom is set but not too brown. Carefully remove from the pan (no need to flip) and place on a plate. Repeat with the rest of the mixture, adding a touch more oil if the pan seems dry. Stack the omelettes on top of each other and cool. Don’t worry if they rip or buckle, but do stack them up as flat as possible. Once cool enough to handle, roll them up carefully into a tight sausage and slice thinly with a sharp knife."

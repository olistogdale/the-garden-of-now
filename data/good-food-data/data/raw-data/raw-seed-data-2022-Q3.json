Push the tips of the dumplings slightly inward at the ends so that the ends have the same diameter as the middle; this way the dumplings will cook evenly.

Slide the dumplings into the boiling water, then turn down the heat and gently lift them off the bottom of the pan using a wooden spoon, if you need to. Simmer for 8 mins, carefully turning them several times during cooking. When you take the dumplings out, put them on a cooling rack and pierce them with a skewer along the length so that the steam comes out and they don't overcook. Cut into slices to serve. You can do this easily using a piece of strong cotton thread: slide it under the log, bring the ends up on each side, cross them over and pull. Serve the dumplings with stews and casseroles."

Lay five of the strips vertically over the pie, then weave with the remaining five horizontally, to create an even lattice over the fruit.
